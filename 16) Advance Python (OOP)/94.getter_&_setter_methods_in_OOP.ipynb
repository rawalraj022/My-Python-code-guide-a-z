    "# getter & setter methods in OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lesson, we have learned about the concept of encapsulation in OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the technique of making the fields in a class private and providing access to the fields via public methods. These methods are called getter and setter methods. Getter methods help us to access the value of a private field, and setter methods help us to set the value of a private field.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can use Encapsulation to protect the data from being modified by accident. For example, I can set the age of a person to a negative number, which is not possible in real life. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this lesson, I will show you how to create getter and setter methods in Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If I have to change something inside our private property, how can I say my junior developer to do the changes inside that , for that **I can use getter and setter methods inside the class** and I can say to my junior developer to use these methods to change the value of the private property.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getter Method\n",
    "\n",
    "A getter method is a method that gets the value of a specific property. A getter method is also known as an accessor method. getter methods are used to access the value of a private field from outside the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, getter methods are public methods that are used to access the value of a private field from outside the class in a controlled way (read-only) without directly accessing the field itself (private field) from outside the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a getter method is created using the `@property` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.__name = name\n",
    "        self.__age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def name(self):\n",
    "        return self.__name\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def age(self):\n",
    "        return self.__age\n",
    "\n",
    "person = Person('John', 30)\n",
    "print(person.name)  # John\n",
    "print(person.age)   # 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, I have created two getter methods `name` and `age` using the `@property` decorator. The `name` getter method returns the value of the `__name` field, and the `age` getter method returns the value of the `__age` field. \n",
    "\n",
    "I can access the value of the `__name` and `__age` fields using the `name` and `age` getter methods from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setter Method\n",
    "\n",
    "A setter method is a method that sets the value of a specific property. A setter method is also known as a mutator method. Setter methods are used to set the value of a private field from outside the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, setter methods are public methods that are used to set the value of a private field from outside the class in a controlled way (write-only) without directly setting the field itself (private field) from outside the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a setter method is created using the `@<property_name>.setter` decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.__name = name\n",
    "        self.__age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def name(self):\n",
    "        return self.__name\n",
    "\n",
    "    @name.setter\n",
    "    def name(self, name):\n",
    "        self.__name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    @property\n",
    "    def age(self):\n",
    "        return self.__age\n",
    "\n",
    "    @age.setter\n",
    "    def age(self, age):\n",
    "        self.__age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "person = Person('John', 30)\n",
    "print(person.name)  # John\n",
    "print(person.age)   # 30\n",
    "\n",
    "person.name = 'Doe'\n",
    "person.age = 40\n",
    "\n",
    "print(person.name)  # Doe\n",
    "print(person.age)   # 40\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, I have created two setter methods `name` and `age` using the `@<property_name>.setter` decorator. The `name` setter method sets the value of the `__name` field, and the `age` setter method sets the value of the `__age` field.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I can set the value of the `__name` and `__age` fields using the `name` and `age` setter methods from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Getter methods are used to access the value of a private field from outside the class.\n",
    "- Setter methods are used to set the value of a private field from outside the class.\n",
    "- Getter and setter methods are public methods that are used to access and set the value of a private field in a controlled way (read-only and write-only) without directly accessing the field itself from outside the class.\n",

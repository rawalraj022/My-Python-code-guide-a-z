    "- We’ll using one story to explain this Encapsulation concept because it is complete practical understanding . So, let’s go to the our code editor and try to understand what is Encapsulation inside OOP ?\n",

    "Encapsulation is a fundamental object-oriented principle in Python. It protects your **classes** from accidental changes or deletions and promotes code reusability and maintainability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is capsule or wrapping of data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit called a **class**. It is a way to restrict access to some of the object's components.\n",

    "Let's say **I am working in a company** and I am working as a **senior developer**. So, We know **senior developers write** any kinds of **function** or write any kinds of **class**. Let's say I have written this particular class called ATM in above code. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, I have a project and Inside project we have to implement ATM machine code functionality. So, It is my responsibility to design this particular class called ATM. So, I have designed this class called ATM and everything is working fine. We have tested this class and everything is working fine. Here, we can create the pin and we can change the pin and we can withdraw the money. Everything is working fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing this ATM class, I'll try to handover this class to my junior developer. So, What junior developer will try to do is junior developer will try to integrate this functionality in the actual ATM machine or in the actual website and this task is given to junior developer. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, As a senior programmer , I have to design the code module always or class. This is always happens in all the industry that senior developer always design the code module or class and junior developer always integrate the code module or class in the actual project or software or website. Because our company won't be giving the responsibility to implement the code functionality to junior developer. Because junior developer doesn't have that much experience. So, that's why senior developer always design the code module or class and junior developer always integrate the code module or class in the actual project or software or website.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why as a **senior programmer it's my responsibility to maintain this particular class itself** and after implementation **senior developer will handover this class to junior developer** and **junior developer will try to test it , whether it is working fine or not.** If it is not working fine then junior developer will give the feedback to senior developer and senior developer will try to fix the issue and again handover the class to junior developer.

    "#### Example :\n",
    "Let's say inside our company there is a junior programmer and he is like very clever and he's like very crazy. let's say he is thinking sir has given me this particular class , now what he will try do find out one mistake I have done and I will get fired from the company. let's say these kinds of thought actually he is having . So what he will do , let's say I have given ATM class to the junior programmer. Now as a junior programmer what he will do : \n",
    "\n",
    "1) First of all he will initialize a object first of all. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "obj = Atm()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2) now he'll just to give data to the balance variable. If we execute this code then it will work fine. We can create and access class variable outside the class. It is possible in python. We can store anythings inside the class variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "obj.balance = \"hello\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Now If he try to check the balance then it will give the output as \"hello\". So, he can access the class variable outside the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "obj.check_balance()\n",
    "```\n",
    "```output\n",
    "Your balance is hello\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- so, this is the problem, Our balance should be integer but he has given the string value to the balance variable and he can access the class variable outside the class. So, this is the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Now if he try to withdraw the money then, there will be an error because we have given the string value to the balance variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "obj.withdraw()\n",
    "```\n",
    "```output\n",
    "TypeError: '<=' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, This is throwing an error because we have given the string value to the balance variable and we can access the class variable outside the class. So, this is the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, my manager will come and manager will blame me because I am a senior programmer and say's what kinds of code you have written because it is failing in the production and that time actually he will fire me from the company because as a senior developer if I am writing these kinds of code then it is not good. No one will give me another chance. So, junior developer can do some crazy things in our code and he will get the promotion. \n",
    "\n",
    "**That is where actually encapsulation concept comes into the picture.** Encapsulation means there is a concept inside OOP called **private variable and private method.** So, we can make the variable private and we can make the method private. So, **that no one can access the variable outside the class.** So, that is the concept of encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to protect our sensitive variable from outside the class then we can make the variable private. So, that no one can access the variable outside the class.\n",

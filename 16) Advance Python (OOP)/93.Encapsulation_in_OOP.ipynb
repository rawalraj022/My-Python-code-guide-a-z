    "Let's say **I am working in a company** and I am working as a **senior developer**. So, We know **senior developers write** any kinds of **function** or write any kinds of **class**. Let's say I have written this particular class called ATM in above code. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, I have a project and Inside project we have to implement ATM machine code functionality. So, It is my responsibility to design this particular class called ATM. So, I have designed this class called ATM and everything is working fine. We have tested this class and everything is working fine. Here, we can create the pin and we can change the pin and we can withdraw the money. Everything is working fine.\n",

    "So, As a senior programmer , I have to design the code module always or class. This is always happens in all the industry that senior developer always design the code module or class and junior developer always integrate the code module or class in the actual project or software or website. Because our company won't be giving the responsibility to implement the code functionality to junior developer. Because junior developer doesn't have that much experience.

So what he will do , let's say I have given ATM class to the junior programmer. Now as a junior programmer what he will do : \n",
    "\n",
    "1) First of all he will initialize a object first of all. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "obj = Atm()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2) now he'll just to give data to the balance variable. If we execute this code then it will work fine. We can create and access class variable outside the class. It is possible in python. We can store anythings inside the class variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "obj.balance = \"hello\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Now If he try to check the balance then it will give the output as \"hello\". So, he can access the class variable outside the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "obj.check_balance()\n",
    "```\n",
    "```output\n",
    "Your balance is hello\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- so, this is the problem, Our balance should be integer but he has given the string value to the balance variable and he can access the class variable outside the class. So, this is the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Now if he try to withdraw the money then, there will be an error because we have given the string value to the balance variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "obj.withdraw()\n",
    "```\n",
    "```output\n",
    "TypeError: '<=' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, This is throwing an error because we have given the string value to the balance variable and we can access the class variable outside the class. So, this is the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, my manager will come and manager will blame me because I am a senior programmer and say's what kinds of code you have written because it is failing in the production and that time actually he will fire me from the company because as a senior developer if I am writing these kinds of code then it is not good. No one will give me another chance. So, junior developer can do some crazy things in our code and he will get the promotion. \n",
    "\n",
    "**That is where actually encapsulation concept comes into the picture.** Encapsulation means there is a concept inside OOP called **private variable and private method.** So, we can make the variable private and we can make the method private.

    "\n",
    "Instead of using the variable like before , **we can use like positive sign or negative sign before the variable name.** So, that it will become private variable. When we use the positive sign before the variable name then it will become public variable and when we use the negative sign before the variable name then it will become private variable.  \n",

    "So, Whenever we are working in the industry as a senior programmer then and if we're using any kinds of private property then our junior programmer have the responsibility . So, that junior programmer won't be changing anything inside the private property. This is called actually adultness. These kinds of adultness our junior programmer should have. If junior programmer doesn't have that means there is a definitely some issue with our company culture. So, that's why we have to maintain the adultness in our company.\n",

    "If we doesn't accidently change the private variable inside the **class variable or class methods** then we can use this encapsulation concept that means we can use private property that time. \n",

    "So, Whenever we see the double underscore before the variable name or method name then we have to consider that it is a private property or private method and I don't need to change anything inside the private property or private method because it's not recommended because python is made for adult person.

    "At that time as a senior programmer we won't be allowing the junior programmer or telling our junior programmer to call the object and change the private variable. We as senior programmer won't be giving these kinds of suggestion to junior programmer. \n",
    "Instead of that what we will do ? => We will use another concept inside encapsulation called **getter and setter method**. So, that we can change the value inside the private property.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next video we will learn about getter and setter method inside encapsulation concept. So, that we can change the value inside the private property. These are the recommended way to change the value inside the private property as a senior programmer. \n",
    "As a senior programmer if we want to change the value inside the private property ourself or we want to give the permission to junior programmer to change the value inside the private property or public property then we have to use the getter and setter method.\n",

    "So, Whenever we are creating software or create any kinds of project and if we are using any sensitive variable or sensitive function, so make sure we're using these private or public symbol before the variable name or method name. So, that no one can change the value inside the private property or private method.\n",
    "\n",
    "No need to make every thing public otherwise what will happen they will directly able to change our variable or function. So, make sure we're using the private property or private method. So, that no one can change the value inside the private property or private method.\n",
    "So, instead of reflecting in the actual private variable , it will create a new variable inside the class. Until and unless junior programmer not calling in that way because junior programmer won't be calling in that way because he is a adult programmer and he knows that this is the private property , he don't need to change anything inside the private property. So, that's why he won't be calling in that way. This the concept of encapsulation in OOP.\n",

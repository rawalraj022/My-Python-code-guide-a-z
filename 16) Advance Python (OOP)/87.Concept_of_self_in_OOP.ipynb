    "What is self in OOP in Python?\n",
    "=> self is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access variables that belong to the class. It is used to access methods that belong to the class. It is used to access the attributes of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we use self in OOP in Python?\n",
    "=> We use self in OOP in Python to access the attributes and methods of the class. It is used to access the variables and methods of the class. It is used to access the attributes and methods of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP(Object Oriented Programming) in Python,  there is a Golden Rule that we should always remember:  **Inside class whatever property we are writing, it can only access the object of the class.** \n",
    "\n",
    "**If we want to access the class property, we need to use self keyword.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we want to make any function or method the property of the class, we need to use self keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we want to communicate one method to another method, we need to use self keyword.\n",
    "    **Eg in below code:**\n",
    "    - I was calling menu method inside create pin method. So, I need to use self keyword to call menu method inside create pin method. Two methods are communicating with each other because of self keyword. First of all we are calling the object of the ATMMachine then, we are calling the method of the ATMMachine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whenever we are creating the class, we need to pass self keyword as the first argument in the method of the class. So, that we can access the properties of the class and we can access the methods of the class using self keyword.\n",

    "# Method Overriding in OOP :\n",
    "\n",
    "Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses. When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Means child class has the ability to change the implementation of a method which is already provided by its parent class. Like in the example below, we have a class `Animal` and a class `Dog` which is a subclass of `Animal`. The `Dog` class has a method `sound()` which overrides the method `sound()` of the `Animal` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal makes a sound\") \n",

    "#### Problem :\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a class `Animal` and a class `Dog` which is a subclass of `Animal`. The `Animal` class has a method `sound()` which prints \"Animal makes a sound\". The `Dog` class has a method `sound()` which prints \"Dog barks\". You have to create a class `Cat` which is a subclass of `Animal`. The `Cat` class should have a method `sound()` which prints \"Cat meows\".\n",

    "#### Input :\n",

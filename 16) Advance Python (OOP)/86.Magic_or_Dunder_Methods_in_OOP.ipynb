    "# Magic Methods or Dunder Methods in OOP Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Magic Methods?\n",
    "Magic methods are special methods that are used to define the behavior of objects. They are also known as Dunder methods. Dunder stands for Double Underscore. These methods are surrounded by double underscores. For example, `__init__` is a magic method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Magic methods are very important when we are creating the big applications because whenever we create an function or method in the class, we have to call that method to get the output **but in the case of magic methods (constructor), we don't have to call them, they are called automatically when certain conditions are met.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are Magic Methods used?\n",
    "Magic methods are used to define the behavior of objects. They are called automatically when certain conditions are met. For example, when we create an object of a class, the `__init__` method is called automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Magic methods(constructor) are very useful during building the big applications because we don't have to call them explicitly, they are called automatically when certain conditions are met. We will give the control to the user to do the things in the way they want.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Magic Methods\n",
    "There are many magic methods in Python. Some of the most commonly used magic methods are:\n",
    "1. `__init__`: This method is called when an object is created.\n",
    "2. `__str__`: This method is called when we use the `print()` function on an object.\n",
    "3. `__add__`: This method is called when we use the `+` operator on objects.\n",
    "4. `__sub__`: This method is called when we use the `-` operator on objects.\n",
    "5. `__mul__`: This method is called when we use the `*` operator on objects.\n",
    "6. `__truediv__`: This method is called when we use the `/` operator on objects.\n",
    "7. `__eq__`: This method is called when we use the `==` operator on objects.\n",
    "8. `__lt__`: This method is called when we use the `<` operator on objects.\n",
    "9. `__gt__`: This method is called when we use the `>` operator on objects.\n",
    "10. `__le__`: This method is called when we use the `<=` operator on objects.\n",
    "11. `__ge__`: This method is called when we use the `>=` operator on objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "Let's see an example of using magic methods in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a class `Point` that represents a point in 2D space. We want to define the behavior of objects of this class using magic methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will define the following magic methods for the `Point` class: `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, `__truediv__`, `__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__le__`, `__ge__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` method will initialize the `x` and `y` coordinates of the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__str__` method will return a string representation of the point.\n"

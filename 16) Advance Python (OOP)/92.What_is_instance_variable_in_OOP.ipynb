    "# What is instance variable in OOP in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance variables are variables that can store different data in the same variable for the different objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We can take the same variable but store different data in it for different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instance variable are created inside the constructor method `__init__` and are accessed using the `self` keyword inside the class. Instance variables are unique to each object of the class. In the example above, `person1` and `person2` have their own `name` and `age` instance variables that are independent of each other. This is the basic concept of instance variables in object-oriented programming in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can take the same variable but store different data in it for different objects so this is called instance variable. That is why this variable is very special variable or powerful variable in OOP in Python because in our normal variable we can't store different types of data in the same variable but in instance variable we can store different types of data in the same variable for different objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, instance variables are variables that are bound to the object itself. **They are created inside the constructor method `__init__` and are accessed using the `self` keyword inside the class.**\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:               # class name is Person\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age): # constructor method\n",
    "        self.name = name      # instance variable is name for storing name and self is used to access the instance variable\n",
    "        self.age = age       # instance variable is age for storing age and self is used to access the instance variable\n",
    "\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 25)     # object of class Person is person1 and we are passing the name and age of the person in the object of class Person\n",
    "person2 = Person(\"Bob\", 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(person1.name) # Alice\n",
    "print(person1.age) # 25\n",

    "print(person2.name) # Bob\n",
    "print(person2.age) # 30\n",
    "```\n",

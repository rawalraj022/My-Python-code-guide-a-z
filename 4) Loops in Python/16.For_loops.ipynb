    "\n",
    "i) While loop \n",
    "\n",
    "ii) For loop \n",
    "\n",
    "- In this season we will going to learn about For loop .\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q) What is For loop ?** \n",
    "\n",
    "⇒ If we want to repeat one specific task continuously this is called loop . \n",
    "\n",
    "⇒ Same as while loop which works for the repetitive task , Same thing also does this For loop which works for the repetitive task . \n",
    "\n",
    "⇒ But syntax wise For loop is different from while loop .\n",
    "\n",
    "- For loop is very powerful and used in different datatype .\n",
    "\n",
    "#### for loop can iterate all kind of data types like string , list , tuple , set , dictionary etc .\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax of For loop :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

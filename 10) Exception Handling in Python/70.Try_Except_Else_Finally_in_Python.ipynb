    "#### Use case of finally block :\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In such cases we can use finally block to close the resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example:**\n",
    "Let's say in application like facebook is using database to store the user data. \n",
    "\n",
    "When ever facebook application is running , it will open the database connection because facebook application stores the user data in database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say there is an condition where facebook get down or facebook get crashed or facebook get hacked. What will happens , as a developer we have to write one logic to close the database connection as soon as possible because we don't want to keep the database connection open when the application is down or crashed or hacked because if we keep the database connection open then the hacker can easily hack the database and he can easily access the user data which is stored in database and he can easily manipulate the user data which is stored in database and he can easily delete the user data which is stored in database and he can easily insert the user data which is stored in database and he can easily update the user data which is stored in database and he can easily do anything with the user data which is stored in database.\n",

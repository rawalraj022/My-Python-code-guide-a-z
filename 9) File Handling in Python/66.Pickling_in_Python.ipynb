    "#### Pickling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pickling** is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and **unpickling** is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pickling processing we use whenever let's say we work in the field of **machine learning, deep learning** and we have trained a model and we want to save that model for future use. So, we can save that model in a binary format using the pickling method and whenever we want to use that model we can load that model from the binary file which is json file in this case and we can use that model for prediction purposes or for any other purposes as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In machine learning** we have two kinds of condition, first of all we have to train the model with respect to our data and after **training the model** what we have to do is prediction on top of the new data . So, whenever we train the model that particular training model we have to save in a file so that we can load that particular later on and we can do the predication after that on top of the new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to save this particular model we use this particular pickling format. That means whatever machine learning model we are training at the end we are getting a python file object ( python file object is nothing but a python object which is nothing but a python dictionary which contains all the information about the model which we have trained ) , so we can save that python file object in a binary format using the pickling method and whenever we want to use that model we can load that model from the binary file which is json file in this case and we can use that model for prediction purposes or for any other purposes as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **our previous notebook**, we saw actually how we can store any kinds of python data type ( data type in python like list, tuple, dictionary, set, string, integer, float, boolean, None, complex, bytes, bytearray, range, frozenset, etc. ) in a file format like json file format , txt file format . \n",
    "But we can't save any kinds of object as it is , it is not possible. So, that's why we have to use this particular pickling technique inside the python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in **this particular notebook** we will see how we can save any kinds of python object ( python object is made up of different collections of data types like list, tuple, dictionary, set, string, integer, float, boolean, None, complex, bytes, bytearray, range, frozenset, etc. ) in a binary format using the pickling method . \n",

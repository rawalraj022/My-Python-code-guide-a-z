    "# List Comprehension in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "List Comprehension provides a concise way of creating lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses and returns a new list. \n",
    "\n",
    "In big companies, it is important to write code that is easy to read and understand. List comprehension is a way to write clean and readable code. Most of the time, list comprehension is used to replace loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "More developers are using list comprehension because it is more efficient and faster than loops. So it is important to understand how to use list comprehension in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"kiwi\", \"mango\"] # List of fruits\n",
    "newlist = [x for x in fruits if \"a\" in x]   # Selects fruits containing 'a' in the name \n",
    "print(newlist)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "['apple', 'banana', 'mango']\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of List Comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "- More time-efficient and space-efficient than loops.\n",
    "- Require fewer lines of code.\n",
    "- Transforms iterative statement into a formula.\n"

    "# Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple in Python is similar to a list. The difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas we can change the elements of a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, a tuple is an immutable list. A tuple can not be changed in any way once it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple store data in same way as list but it is immutable. It is created by placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses `()`, separated by commas. The parentheses are optional, but it is a good practice to use them. A tuple can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, list, string, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "It store data in ordered form like list. Ordered means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change unless the tuple is modified in some way or another way. In memory, tuple store data in contiguous memory location. Contiguous memory location means that all the elements of tuple are stored in a single memory location. Single memory location will help to access the elements of tuple in faster way as compared to list. So, tuple is faster than list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, when we are creating a application or a program, First of all we have to think what problem we are going to solve and then we have to think about the data type we are going to use. \n",
    "Like Example if we have to add items in application then we have to use list data type. If we have to use data which is not going to change then we have to use tuple data type. In this way we have to think about the data type we are going to use. In case if we have to change the data type then we can use type casting. \n",

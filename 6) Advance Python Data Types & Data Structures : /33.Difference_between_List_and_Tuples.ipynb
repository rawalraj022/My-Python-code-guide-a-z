    "# Difference between Lists and Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Syntax**\n",
    "- Lists are enclosed in square brackets `[]` and Tuples are enclosed in parentheses `()` so, syntax is the main difference between lists and tuples. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Mutability**\n",
    "- Lists are mutable, which means that you can change their content without changing their identity. You can add, remove, or modify elements in a list. Tuples are immutable, which means that once they are created, their size and content cannot be changed. so, you can't add, remove, or modify elements in a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Speed**\n",
    "- Tuples are generally faster than lists. Tuples have a fixed size so Python does not need to resize them. This gives tuples a slight performance advantage for fixed-size collections. so, if you are defining a constant set of values and all you are ever going to do with it is iterate through it, use a tuple instead of a list. But if you need to add, remove, or modify elements in a collection, use a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Memory**\n",
    "- Tuples are more memory-efficient than lists. Tuples do not need to keep track of any free space, unlike lists, which need to allocate extra space to accommodate new items. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "L = list(range(1000))\n",
    "T = tuple(range(1000))\n",
    "\n",
    "print('List size',sys.getsizeof(L))\n",
    "print('Tuple size',sys.getsizeof(T))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```Output\n",
    "List size 9112\n",
    "Tuple size 8056\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Built in functionality**\n",
    "- Lists have more built-in methods than tuples. Lists have several built-in methods, such as append(), extend(), remove(), and reverse(). These methods modify the list they are called on. Tuples have only two built-in methods: count() and index(). so, if you need to add, remove, or modify elements in a collection, use a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Error prone**\n",
    "- Tuples are less error-prone than lists. Tuples are immutable, so you can't accidentally modify the contents of a tuple. This makes tuples less error-prone than lists, especially when you are passing them between functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [1,2,3]\n",
    "b = a\n",
    "\n",
    "a.append(4)\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "print(b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```Output\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "So, if you want to ensure that the contents of a collection do not change, use a tuple instead of a list. But if you need to add, remove, or modify elements in a collection, use a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = (1,2,3)\n",
    "b = a\n",
    "\n",
    "a = a + (4,)\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "print(b)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```Output\n",
    "(1, 2, 3, 4)\n",
    "(1, 2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "So, if you want to ensure that the contents of a collection do not change, use a tuple instead of a list. But if you need to add, remove, or modify elements in a collection, use a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Usability**\n",
    "- Lists are more usable than tuples. Lists are more versatile than tuples. Lists are used more frequently than tuples. so, if you are defining a constant set of values and all you are ever going to do with it is iterate through it, use a tuple instead of a list. But if you need to add, remove, or modify elements in a collection, use a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, in projects, you should use lists when you have a collection of data that does need to change, and you should use tuples when you have a collection of data that does not need to change.\n",

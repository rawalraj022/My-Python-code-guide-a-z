    "### 1) Arithmetic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operations are the operations that we perform on the list elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the arithmetic operations we can only perform addition '+' and multiplication '*' operations. Like adding two lists, multiplying the list with a number, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1) Adding two lists\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add two lists by using the '+' operator. The '+' operator concatenates the two lists and returns a new list.\n",

    "L2 = [4, 5, 6]\n",

    "Multiplying the list with 3 , It will repeat the list elements 3 times. But it will not change the original list. and return a new list.\n",

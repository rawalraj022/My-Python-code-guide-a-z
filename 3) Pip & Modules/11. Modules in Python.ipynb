    "What is a module in Python?\n",
    "=> Module is a file , Inside a file, particular code is written by the other programmer and we can use that code in our program by importing the function of that module in our program and use it without any kind of permission from the programmer who wrote that code because all the modules are available it's completely free for us to use. So we can use module in our program without any kind of permission.\n",

    "=> Module is a file that contains Python code. A module can define functions, classes, and variables. A module can also include runnable code.\n",

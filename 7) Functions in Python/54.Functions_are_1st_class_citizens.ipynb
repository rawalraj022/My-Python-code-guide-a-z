    "# Functions are 1st class citizens : \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, functions are first-class citizens. This means that they can be treated like any other value. They can be passed as arguments to functions, returned from functions, assigned to variables, and stored in data structures. This is a powerful feature that allows for more modular and flexible code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It acts like data types, which means we can assign them to variables, store them in data structures, pass them as arguments to functions, and return them from functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In functional programming, functions are often used as arguments to other functions. This allows for higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. This can be used to create more concise and expressive code. \n",
    "\n",
    "The operations which are performed on other data types like int, float, string, list, tuple, dictionary, set, etc. are also performed on functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The functions are also treated as objects in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other programming languages, functions are not first-class citizens. They cannot be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, or assigned to variables. However, in Python, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be treated like any other value. **This allows for more modular and flexible code that will help to build powerful applications like  web applications, data analysis, machine learning, mac applications , android applications, etc. in Python. and also allows for powerful features such as higher-order functions like map, filter, reduce, etc. Also Libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc. are built on top of this concept.** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here is an example of a higher-order function that takes a function as an argument:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def apply_function(func, arg):\n",
    "    return func(arg)\n",
    "\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",
    "result = apply_function(square, 5)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `apply_function` function takes another function `func` as an argument and applies it to the argument `arg`. We then define a `square` function that squares its input, and use `apply_function` to apply the `square` function to the number `5`. This demonstrates how functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions can also be returned from other functions. Here is an example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def create_adder(x):\n",
    "    def adder(y):\n",
    "        return x + y\n",
    "    return adder\n",
    "\n",
    "add_5 = create_adder(5)\n",
    "result = add_5(3)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `create_adder` function returns another function `adder` that adds a constant `x` to its input `y`. We then use `create_adder` to create an `add_5` function that adds `5` to its input, and apply it to the number `3`. This demonstrates how functions can be returned from other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions can also be assigned to variables and stored in data structures. This allows for more modular and flexible code. Here is an example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "greet_someone = greet\n",
    "result = greet_someone(\"Alice\")\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we assign the `greet` function to the variable `greet_someone`, and then use `greet_someone` to greet the person named \"Alice\". This demonstrates how functions can be assigned to variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **conclusion**, functions are first-class citizens in Python, which means they can be treated like any other value. This allows for more modular and flexible code, and enables powerful features such as higher-order functions. By understanding this concept, you can write more concise and expressive code that takes full advantage of the functional programming paradigm.\n",
